# Renewable energy production in the USA 1973-2023 (time series analysis and prediction)

During my Erasmus in MÃ¡laga I had to submit a group project where my team and I had to choose a real dataset in order to model it as a time series. Eventually, we chose to model, analyze and predict the production of renewable energy in the USA from 1973 to 2023. We got the dataset from Kaggle and it contained monthly data for more than 50 years (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristianlapenta/renewable-energy-production-1973-2023). We used the Box-Jenkins method using an seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA).
