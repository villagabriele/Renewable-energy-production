# RenewableEnergyProduction

During my Erasmus in MÃ¡laga I had to submit a group project where my team and I had to chose a real dataset in order to model it as a time series. Eventually, we chose to modelize, analyze and predict the production of renewable energy in the USA from 1973 to 2023. We got the dataset from Kaggle and it contained monthly data for more than 60 years (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristianlapenta/renewable-energy-production-1973-2023). We used the Box-Jenkins method using an seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA).
